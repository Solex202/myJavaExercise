 /*(Invoice Class) Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent
        an invoice for an item sold at the store. An Invoice should include four pieces of information as
        instance variables—a part number (type String), a part description (type String), a quantity of the
        item being purchased (type int) and a price per item (double). Your class should have a constructor
        that initializes the four instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable.
        In addition, provide a method named getInvoiceAmount that calculates the invoice amount (i.e.,
        multiplies the quantity by the price per item), then returns the amount as a double value. If the
        quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. If the price per item is not positive, it should be set to
        0.0. Write a test app named InvoiceTest that demonstrates class Invoice’s capabilities.


import java.util.Scanner;

public class Invoice {

    private String partNumber;
    private String partDescription;
    private int quantity;
    private double price;

        public Invoice(String partNumber, String partDescription, int quantity, double price) {


            public String getPartNumber{
                return partNumber;
            }

            public String getPartDescription{
                return partDescription;
            }

            public int getQuantity{
                return quantity;
            }

            public double getPrice{
                return price;
            }

            public void setPartNumber{
                this.partNumber = partNumber;
            }

            public void setPartDescription{
                this.partDescription = partDescription;
            }

            public void setQuantity{
                this.quantity = quantity;
            }

            public void setPrice{
                this.price = price;
            }
            public String getInvoiceName {
                return invoiceName;
            }
