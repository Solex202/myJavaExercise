/*4.19 (Sales Commission Calculator) A large company pays its salespeople on a commission basis.
        The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For example, a
        salesperson who sells $5,000 worth of merchandise in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5000, or a
        total of $650. Youâ€™ve been supplied with a list of the items sold by each salesperson. The values of
        these items are as follows:
        Item Value
        1 239.99
        2 129.75
        3 99.95
        4 350.89*/
